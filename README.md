Capstone project - recognition of dog breeds

**Introduction**

This is an educational project where I use Convolutional Neural Networks to detect dog breeds on pictures. Besides its educational purpost it is also entertaning, because you can also fill in pictures of humans and it will return the dog breed the person looks like.

**Main Questions**

The main question (or better task) of this project was to understand how Convolutional Neural Networks can be implemented in python, how keras as libary can be used and if it is possible to detect dog breeds with relatively small time consumption.

**Used Libaries**

The following libaries are used in the project:
- sklearn
- keras
- numpy
- glob
- random
- cv2
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- PIL
- extract_bottleneck_features

**Architecture**

The project is in a JupiterNotebook but within this notebook it is split in 8 steps:


- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 6: Write your Algorithm
- Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

Besides the jupiter notebook, there are several other data structures used which are explained in the Installation Instruktions below.


**Results**

The result is a model that is able to classify pictures by dog breeds. If you fill in a picture of a human or a dog, it is able to detect if it is a human or a dog and in the second step it assignes the picture to a dog breed. I tested the output with some pictures from picabay.com (free to use) and the results are quite good.

**Challenges and Learnings**

In this project I had to learn CNN from zero. I did not have any knowledge about neuronal networks but by reading articles on Wikipedia, Readme's from keras and some blogposts about the topic. I gained some knowledge and were able to generate a CNN that classifies dogs to its breeds.

** Installation Instructions**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Download the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. (Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

6. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create (and activate) a new environment.

	- __Linux__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-linux.yml` to `requirements/dog-linux-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-linux.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	- __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-mac.yml` to `requirements/dog-mac-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-mac.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-windows.yml` to `requirements/dog-windows-gpu.yml`):  
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-windows.yml
	activate dog-project
	```

7. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)** and Step 6 throws errors, try this __alternative__ step to create your environment.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`): 
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	source activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):  
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	
8. (Optional) **If you are using AWS**, install Tensorflow.
```
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
```
	
9. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
		```
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
		```
	- __Windows__: 
		```
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
		```

10. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `dog-project` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
```

11. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

12. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/810/view).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.
- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. __Please do not include the project data sets in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.  Likewise, please do not include the `bottleneck_features/` folder.__

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.
